For those that don‚Äôt know why I seem so excited, it‚Äôs because\n> # I‚Äôve never cooked in my entire life.\n\nApart from putting together Nutella or jam on toast‚Ä¶ or asking one of my friends how to turn on the stove to make pre-made [paratha](https://www.google.com/search?q=paratha&oq=paratha&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1457j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). Yea, really had no clue how to cook. I‚Äôve always wanted to learn but either I didn‚Äôt make time for it or I lowkey feared burning up the entire house.\n\nBefore coming over to Asia, I told myself I need to get an apartment that has a kitchen, why? Because this is the perfect opportunity to learn and I should try to take advantage.\n\nAnyways, before starting how to cook, I asked a lot of Malays (landlord, colleagues and newly-made friends) if they cooked on their own. And the response I got from every single one of them were:\n>  ‚Äúno, no need to cook when you can buy food here, it‚Äôs so cheap. The time and money it takes to cook, is the same as buying.‚Äù\n\nI wasn‚Äôt shocked at all. I mean Malaysians are widely known for their abundance, diverse and amazing food. Also, it is very cheap, about $2‚Äì5 CAD for an entire meal. So you might ask, why try to cook when you can buy quality food so cheap?\n\nThis was the first time in my life I had alone time from everything back home, and this was the only and perfect opportunity to learn. *I didn‚Äôt have to learn but I chose to.* That being said, I didn‚Äôt restrict myself from buying food (I mean how can you).\n\nNow it‚Äôs time to talk food! When I went grocery shopping, I was so overwhelmed; there were so many items to choose from. I also walked in with no idea and no list of what to get. As one would expect, I left ‚Ä¶ with chocolate cookies at hand of course.\n\nThe next day I decided to watch a video on how to make pasta, now this video was completely in Bengali (my mother tongue) so I won‚Äôt post it here but it was a great start on what I should buy from the grocery store (i.e. my grocery list ‚Äî finally). After buying all the ingredients and watching the video 3‚Äì4x with multiple pauses in between, I made a spicy pasta. After that I went on a cooking frenzy and within 2 weeks I made 5 meals. I was both shocked and astounded as to what the recipes yielded. I still couldn‚Äôt believe I made a dish and I devoured every bit I could.\n\n![~ spicy pasta ~](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4088/1*Oa-_UhGY62DgJWQtx4LKZg.jpeg)\n\n![quick n easy chicken sandwich](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6048/1*U_ZNZzY5UhhMeBKMGqbBDw.jpeg)\n\n![chicken curry (including broccolis) ‚Äî also no need rice cooker, just boil and monitor](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6036/1*SlmA40j47zGk2rZBhiO-Wg.jpeg)\n\n![quick n easy chickpea (with curry)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6048/1*QS1FexYzaPwkYTzPItd8zw.jpeg)\n\n![chicken fried rice (my favourite) ‚Äî fun fact: I left gym early bc I was craving this ‚Ä¶](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7422/1*E1wXlrnjO9g07C0hb7Cmyg.jpeg)\n\nAs you‚Äôve noticed, I haven‚Äôt written down any of the recipes of the foods mentioned above, this would‚Äôve made the blog more exhaustive than it already is; but if you‚Äôre ever curious, I can send you the exact ingredients + how-to recipe.\n\nTill next time ‚úåüèΩ\n\nThank you for making it here:\n\n* if you‚Äôre curious to know about the Cansbridge 19‚Äô bootcamp and my journey there, [click here](https://medium.com/@nayemalam/leaving-home-for-the-summer-a3266a032d9a).\n\n* if you‚Äôre curious to know about my first few days in KL, [click here](https://medium.com/@nayemalam/its-okay-not-to-be-okay-f932e26d82f9).\n\n* If you‚Äôre curious to know where I‚Äôve visited and what I‚Äôve been doing so far in KL, [click here](https://medium.com/@nayemalam/the-sun-reappears-after-the-storm-98b228bdcb7d). <br />\n\nOn another note feel free to follow me on insta as I post on my story quite often: [@nayem_wizdom](https://www.instagram.com/nayem_wizdom/) ‚úåÔ∏è\n\nConnect üëâ [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nayemalam/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nayem_wizdom)\n\nOriginally posted on [Medium](https://medium.com/@nayemalam/i-cooked-for-the-first-time-cd2294677c95) a part of the [`Cansbridge Fellowship`](https://cansbridgefellowship.com/)","publishedAt":"2019-07-02T16:00:00.000Z","slug":"i-cooked-for-the-first-time","readTime":"4","image":{"publicURL":"/static/7db56343af07e73f09eb9bbe208fb94e/705b712125c84f9c6719b1a37fcb9fce.jpg","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDBP/EABYBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIAAf/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABRSYWgqWf/8QAGhAAAwEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECEQMSIf/aAAgBAQABBQJ+OnSNL3jOzRMrP//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQ/9oACAEDAQE/ASf/xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEP/aAAgBAgEBPwFn/8QAHBAAAgICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEBEQIDECKB/9oACAEBAAY/AodCO2nGfSHd8M//xAAcEAEAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhYTFBUYH/2gAIAQEAAT8hvQwHEphG2W7H2SFvmgozHFurup//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAELg//8QAFxEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEhEf/aAAgBAwEBPxBJDEf/xAAXEQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREh/9oACAECAQE/EGdNP//EABoQAQADAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESFRcUH/2gAIAQEAAT8QRVbSgj7AGWrRoeVxiDpd3LPmTWRi2lQAM8qMVu5QHKn/2Q==","aspectRatio":1.492537313432836,"src":"/static/7db56343af07e73f09eb9bbe208fb94e/2f1b1/705b712125c84f9c6719b1a37fcb9fce.jpg","srcSet":"/static/7db56343af07e73f09eb9bbe208fb94e/fd013/705b712125c84f9c6719b1a37fcb9fce.jpg 200w,\n/static/7db56343af07e73f09eb9bbe208fb94e/25252/705b712125c84f9c6719b1a37fcb9fce.jpg 400w,\n/static/7db56343af07e73f09eb9bbe208fb94e/2f1b1/705b712125c84f9c6719b1a37fcb9fce.jpg 800w,\n/static/7db56343af07e73f09eb9bbe208fb94e/0ff54/705b712125c84f9c6719b1a37fcb9fce.jpg 1200w,\n/static/7db56343af07e73f09eb9bbe208fb94e/06655/705b712125c84f9c6719b1a37fcb9fce.jpg 1600w,\n/static/7db56343af07e73f09eb9bbe208fb94e/7344c/705b712125c84f9c6719b1a37fcb9fce.jpg 4240w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}},"author":{"name":"Nayem Alam","picture":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"width":50,"height":50,"src":"/static/21f638167b995fe1fa8b1d6df5cbcde1/9252b/3e8da90f630388173cd639f293b81fcd.jpg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"i-cooked-for-the-first-time","prev":null,"next":{"title":"Uses","strapiId":9,"slug":"uses"}}}
