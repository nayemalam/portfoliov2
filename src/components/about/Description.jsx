                On my free time, I like to play basketball, workout and spend time with family. 
                Iâ€™m always excited to work on projects as Iâ€™ve been continuously working on <a href="http://speakupmtl.com/"><span className='customLink'>Speak Up</span></a>, which is a 
                unique slam poetry competition to give our youth an outlet to express themselves. I also run a 
                side hustle, <a href="http://emreld.com/"><span className='customLink'>Emreld</span></a>, which is a web design agency 
                to help jumpstart their business(es) at an affordable rate. I enjoy clean, elegant styling, and I have lots of experience in the production of modern websites. 
                I love designing aesthetically pleasing sites as per my clientsâ€™ needs. Finally, I was once a content creator back in grades 
                7 to 9 making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TechTutorialsz"><span className='customLink'>YouTube</span></a> videos!

                During my undergrad, Iâ€™ve devoted my extra-curricular time to being the head of marketing of 
                McGillâ€™s <a href="https://www.mcgilleus.ca/juniorcounil"><span className='customLink'>Junior Council</span></a>,
                the project manager, director of corporate relations and web designer for 
                the <a href="https://nobemcgill.org/"><span className='customLink'>National Organization of Business & Engineering</span></a> and 
                the web master for <a href="http://mcgillchemecar.com/"><span className='customLink'>McGill Chem-E Car</span></a>. 
                Finally, I've also worked closely with the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/engine/"><span className='customLink'>McGill EngInE</span></a> team 
                to curate the <a href="http://mcgilldesignconsultancy.com/"><span className='customLink'>McGill Design Consultancy</span></a>; whose goal 
                is to provide a centralized place for all design-related questions, websites and logos for McGill based startups and clubs.
