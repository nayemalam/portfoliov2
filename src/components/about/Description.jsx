                    My name is Nayem Alam, I am a 23yo tech enthusiast with a passion for slam poetry and engineering.
                    I hold a B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering with a Minor in Software Engineering from McGill University. 
                    Through slam poetry I like to use my voice to influence people to make an impact in society. 
                    I also enjoy writing, playing ball, improving my coding while also learning new frameworks, travelling, meeting new people and how can I forget, drinking coffee!

                        When Iâ€™m not in school, I like to play basketball, workout and spend time with family. 
                        Iâ€™m always excited to work on projects as Iâ€™ve been continuously working on <a href="http://speakupmtl.com/"><span class='customLink'>Speak Up</span></a> which is a 
                        unique slam poetry competition to give our youth an outlet to express themselves. I also run a 
                        side hustle, <a href="http://emreld.com/"><span class='customLink'>Emreld</span></a>, which is a web design agency 
                        putting clients first to help jumpstart their business(es). Finally, I was once a content creator back in grades 
                        7-9 making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TechTutorialsz"><span class='customLink'>YouTube</span></a> videos!

                        At school, Iâ€™ve devoted my extra-curricular time to being the head of marketing of 
                        McGillâ€™s <a href="https://www.mcgilleus.ca/juniorcounil"><span class='customLink'>Junior Council</span></a>. 
                        The project manager, director of corporate relations and web designer for 
                        the <a href="https://nobemcgill.org/"><span class='customLink'>National Organization of Business & Engineering</span></a> and 
                        the web master for <a href="http://mcgillchemecar.com/"><span class='customLink'>McGill Chem-E Car</span></a>. 
                        Finally, I've also worked closely with the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/engine/"><span class='customLink'>McGill EngInE</span></a> team 
                        to curate the <a href="http://mcgilldesignconsultancy.com/"><span class='customLink'>McGill Design Consultancy</span></a>; our goal is to build a centralized place for all design-related questions and demands for the McGill community.
