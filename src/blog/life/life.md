Curious to know what my day to day life consists of right now? Well here's high-level list of what projects I am currently occupied with - I tend to update this periodically when things change around:

- building 2 native apps (ios and android)
- building 2 platforms (web)
- consulting for 2 small businesses in web dev
- managing [McGill Design Consultancy](https://mcgilldesignconsultancy.com/)
- managing [Emreld Agency](https://emreld.com/)

`Please note, this post is still WIP`
