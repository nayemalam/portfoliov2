I am often asked how my dev setup is and to be honest, coming from both Apple and Windows, there are a couple of things I use on my day-to-day basis. I tried to list out everything I use to the detail of all my uses.

Editor + Terminal
=================

*   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my current editor for everything web related, and I use the following [settings](https://res.cloudinary.com/nayemalam/raw/upload/v1625242363/VSCode/settings.json)
*   I also use [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) extensively at work
*   I use [Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme) for both the aforementioned editors
*   I use [cmder](https://cmder.net/) on Windows, terminal on Mac
*   I'm currently using [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) for all my editors, including it's Ligatures
