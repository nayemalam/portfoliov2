During the COVID-19 Quarantine I've decided to revamp my entire personal (previous) portfolio [https://nayemalam.github.io/portfolio](https://nayemalam.github.io/portfolio) with React JS.

The previous version of my portfolio (link above) was written in pure HTML, CSS and vanilla JS.

The updated (version 2) of my portfolio is now written in HTML, SASS and React library.

This repository contains the code for my new and updated personal portfolio.

The following project was initially bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (CRA) and now ported to Gatsby JS (completed April 21). You can view the CRA part [here](https://github.com/nayemalam/portfoliov2/tree/cra-backup). Reason? Will be making a blog post about this soon and how to do this; basically it's a static site generator that build and produces only static files to run on the client-end, this way it increases speed drastically, it's SEO friendly and blogging is so much easier.

If you'd like to run this project locally for your own dev experience, feel free to do so; in order to replicate:

```
- git clone https://github.com/nayemalam/portfoliov2.git
- cd into directory
- npm install
- cd functions
- npm install
- gatsby develop
```

This will run the app in development mode. <br/>
Open it up in [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. <br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
